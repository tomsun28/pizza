/**
 * Scheduled tasks are stored per sidecar: the main agent writes to
 * `~/.pizza/main/scheduler`, every other workspace to
 * `~/.pizza/workspaces/<id>/scheduler`. So a task list is always scoped to the
 * workspace the UI is currently attached to, and the RPC layer rejects
 * mismatched scope/workspace pairs. This helper derives that pair from the
 * active workspace cwd so every caller (Schedules page, composer popover)
 * asks for exactly one workspace's tasks.
