/**
 * Gateway scheduler guard — the single owner of "a workspace with runnable
 * scheduled tasks must have a live agent".
 *
 * History: the desktop GUI used to keep its own per-cwd sidecars alive after
 * window close (and re-spawn them from a 15s Rust loop) so cron tasks kept
 * firing. Those sidecars were invisible to the gateway pool and their pids
 * died with the GUI's memory — a GUI restart produced orphan agents and TWO
 * SchedulerEngines dispatching the same tasks.
 *
 * Now the gateway (already a detached daemon that outlives the GUI) owns this:
 * every guard tick it scans all scheduler scopes on disk, and
 *   1. reports the set of scheduled cwds — the pool pins these agents so idle
 *      eviction skips them, and
 *   2. the pool spawns an agent for any scheduled cwd that has none.
 *
 * Each spawned agent runs its own SchedulerEngine for its scope (rpc-mode
 * always builds one), and the engine's cross-process scope lock guarantees a
 * single dispatcher per scope even if some other process lingers.
