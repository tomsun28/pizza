/**
 * Gateway wire protocol — dependency-free types shared by the gateway server
 * (a long-running daemon) and its clients (the `_tell` tool inside an agent,
 * and eventually the desktop bridge / CLI).
 *
 * The gateway is a single Unix-socket (or Windows named-pipe) server that:
 *   1. Owns a pool of agent processes (one per workspace cwd), reusing the
 *      existing {@link RpcClient} infrastructure so a repeat `_tell` to the
 *      same workspace does NOT spawn a fresh agent each time.
 *   2. Routes messages between agents (the router pattern): no agent talks to
 *      another agent directly — every message flows through the gateway.
 *
 * Protocol: newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) over a single connection.
 *
 *   Client → Gateway:
 *     { "type": "tell",  "id": "req_1", "to": "<cwd|name>", "message": "...", "from": { "kind": "agent", "id": "web" }, "timeout": 60000 }
 *     { "type": "ping" }
 *
 *   Gateway → Client:
 *     { "type": "tell_result", "id": "req_1", "ok": true, "reply": "..." }
 *     { "type": "tell_result", "id": "req_1", "ok": false, "error": "..." }
 *     { "type": "pong" }
 *     { "type": "error",  "message": "..." }

 * (an agent tell, a cron tick, a file watcher, a webhook, a human user) is
 * modelled as a message carrying a `MessageSource`, so the context-rendering
 * and reply-routing code is source-agnostic and never needs a new type per
 * originator kind.
 *
 * `kind` is an OPEN set ("user" | "agent" | "cron" | "watcher" | "webhook" | …):
 * new external triggers add a value here without any protocol change. `id`
 * identifies the specific originator — an agents workspace name/cwd, a cron
 * job id, a watcher glob, etc. Together `kind:id` is the serialized address the
 * receiving agent displays and replies to (e.g. `agent:web`).
