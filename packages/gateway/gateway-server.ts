/**
 * Gateway server — the long-running daemon at the heart of agent-to-agent
 * messaging.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   1. Listen on a Unix domain socket (or Windows named pipe) — the single
 *      rendezvous point for all clients.
 *   2. Maintain a pool of {@link RpcClient} connections, one per workspace cwd.
 *      A repeat `_tell` to the same workspace reuses the existing agent process
 *      instead of spawning a fresh one each time.
 *   3. Route `tell` requests: resolve the destination to a cwd, find-or-spawn
 *      the agent, prompt it, and return the agent's final assistant text.
 *
 * The server is process-local state — it lives for the lifetime of the daemon
 * process. It is started via `pizza --mode gateway` and auto-started on demand
 * by the gateway lifecycle module (like `ssh-agent`).
