/**
 * Built-in skills registry.
 *
 * Built-in skills are SKILL.md files that ship with Pizza inside this package
 * (`src/builtin-skills/<id>/SKILL.md`, mirrored under `dist/` at build time).
 * Unlike built-in extensions (enabled unless disabled), built-in skills are
 * DISABLED by default and must be enabled explicitly in `settings.json` under
 * `enabledBuiltinSkills` (see `pizza builtin enable <id>`).
 *
 * To add a new built-in skill:
 * 1. Create a folder under `src/builtin-skills/<id>/` with a valid `SKILL.md`
 *    (frontmatter `name` must match `<id>`; a `description` is required).
 * 2. Register the id in `BUILTIN_SKILL_IDS` below.
 * 3. Keep ids stable: they are persisted in user settings.
