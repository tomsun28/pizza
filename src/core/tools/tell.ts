/**
 * `tell` built-in CLI command — agent-to-agent messaging via the gateway.
 *
 * Routed internally by the `cli` tool (alongside read/write/edit/session_split/
 * history_tree/skill), wired up whenever the runtime has an
 * agent dir (see session-facade-factory.ts).
 *
 * `_tell` sends a message to another agent's workspace through the gateway
 * daemon and returns the target agent's reply. The gateway maintains a pool of
 * long-lived agent processes — repeated tells to the same workspace reuse the
 * agent and its accumulated context. This makes `_tell` conversational: you
 * can have a back-and-forth with another workspace's agent.
 *
 * The gateway is auto-started on demand (like ssh-agent) — the caller never
 * needs to manage it manually.
 *
 * Delivery is asynchronous: `_tell` returns a delivery ack (messageId)
 * immediately and never blocks on the target's turn. The target agent's final
 * reply is relayed back automatically by the gateway as an incoming
 * `<message from="agent:<cwd>">` turn — reply reliability lives in the
 * protocol, not in the receiver remembering to tell back.
